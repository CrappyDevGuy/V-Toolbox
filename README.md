**Vulkan-Toolbox**

just me messing around with Vulkan hoping to one day create a little game engine with Vulkan and create few games with it,
surely not the more efficient nor beautiful, but i like working on it, and that is the most important fact, don't you think ?

this project is written in C++, if you find the code ugly or not optimised the reason is explain by my name
